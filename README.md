# middleman-ruby-3.1
Middleman remains one of the best static website generators available.  Installing it with the latest version of Ruby can be a bit confusing, here is a stable version that works great taking into account the evolutions of the Ruby 3.1's incompatible changes to its YAML module (Psych 4).

## Clone repo & bundle it!

The installation takes place in 2 stages:

1. Clone repo on your disk

> git clone git@github.com:lraboteau/middleman-ruby-3.1.git

2. Use bundle to load all the gems

> cd ~/middleman-ruby-3.1<br />
  bundle
